# 1- write a program to display a person's name, age, and address in three diff lines
# 2- swap two variables
# 3- write a program to convert a float into integer
# 4- write a program to take details froma astudent for id-card and then print it in different lines
# 5- write a program to take an user input as integer then convert it to float
