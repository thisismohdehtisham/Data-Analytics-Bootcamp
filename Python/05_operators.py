# operators and operands in python
#  types of operators
# 1 - arithmetic operator
# a = 3
# b = 6

# print(a+b, a-b, a*b, b/a, b//a)
# print(a**b)

# 2 - Comparisonal Operator
# print(3>2, 8<6)
# == only checking the value
# === also check the type
# print(2==2)
# print( 2 == '2')


# 3 - Logical Operator
# and - both should be true or false
# or - any one of the two is true
# not - reverse the outcome
# print(3>2 and 5>7)
# print(not(3>2 or 5>7))

# 4 - Assignment Operator
# score = 0
# score += 1

# print(score)

# score -= 5
# print(score)

# 5 - Identify Operator
# a = 1234
# b = '1234'
# c = 1234
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)


# 6 - Membership Operators
a = 'hello' 
print('p' in a)
print('e' in a)
print('p' not in a)
print('e' not in a)

# 7 - Bitwise Operators
# print(bin(15))
# print(10 & 3)
# print(14 | 8)

# left shift and right shift
print(10>>2)
print(10<<2)
